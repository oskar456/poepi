{"name":"PoEpi","tagline":"A multi-purpose shield for Raspberry Pi","body":"This is a peripheral board for [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) with\r\nthree separate functions:\r\n\r\n* Power supply with 12-40&nbsp;Volt input and 5&nbsp;Volt, 0.75&nbsp;Amps output,\r\nwith short circuit protection and simple passive PoE extractor (utilizes unused\r\npairs in a Fast Ethernet UTP cable).\r\n* [1-Wire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire) controller\r\n[DS2482-100][DS2482]\r\nconnected to I2C bus of Raspberry Pi.\r\n* Real time clock module\r\n[PCF8583][PCF8583]\r\nwith backup battery.\r\n\r\n[DS2482]: http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/4382\r\n[PCF8583]: http://www.nxp.com/products/interface_and_connectivity/i2c/rtcs_with_i2c_interface/series/PCF8583.html\r\n\r\n![PoEpi prototype](images/PoEpi-proto.png)\r\n\r\nPlease visit the associated [GitHub repository][GH] for schematics and board layout data download.\r\nAll schematics and board layouts are created using [EAGLE 6.2.1 beta](http://www.cadsoftusa.com).\r\n\r\n[GH]: https://github.com/oskar456/poepi\r\n\r\nPower supply\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe key component of the board is a DC/DC power supply, allowing to power Raspberry Pi and its periprherals from distance, using unused pairs in a Fast Ethernet UTP cable. \r\n\r\n> **WARNING:** Only passive PoE extractor is used. This kind of extractor is **NOT** compliant with [IEEE 802.3af][8023af] and connecting UTP cable with power on unused pairs to standard NIC can cause severe damage to it.\r\n\r\n[8023af]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.3af\r\n\r\n![PoEpi supply schematics](images/PoEpi-supply.png)\r\n\r\nThe power supply design utilizes [MCP34063A](http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/product.do?id=MC34063A) switched mode supply regulator in basic step-down mode. This regulator requires minimum other components for operation:\r\n* The inductor L1 and diode D1, together with switch integrated in the IC forms a step-down converter.\r\n* Current sensing resistor R3 limits maximum available current to 0.75 Amps.\r\n* The R4/R5 divider adjust ouput voltage.\r\n* The D2 is a Zener diode with breakdows voltage 5,6 Volt. In case of failure of the integrated switch in IC2, which would result in uncontrollable growth of output voltage, the D2 break open and limit output voltage till the F1 fuse breaks itself.\r\n* The bridge B1 allow either polarity on the RJ-45 connector. Even alternating current can be supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nI2C level shifter\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n![PoEpi voltage level shifter](images/PoEpi-levelshifter.png)\r\n\r\nThe Rapsberry Pi operates with 3.3 Volt logic. Other components on PoEpi uses 5 Volt logic. Althought it is often possible to directly connect 3V3 I2C with 5V I2C bus, it is better to use a simple MOSFET-based level shifter. This one is based on [AN97055](http://ics.nxp.com/support/documents/interface/pdf/an97055.pdf) by NXP. Please note that pull-up resistors on 3V3 side (on the left) are already included in the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nUsing this level shifter also protects Raspberry Pi from being damaged by a high voltage spike from 5V side.\r\n\r\n1-Wire controller\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n![PoEpi 1-Wire controller](images/PoEpi-1wire.png)\r\n\r\n[DS2482-100][DS2482] is a standalone 1-Wire master controller for I2C bus, supported in Linux. It could be used to connect various peripherals like thermometers, using quite long cables. It is connected to 5V I2C bus and the 1-Wire output is provided on a RJ-45 connector. The pinout of the connector is almost compatible with [DS9490R][DS9490], so most accessories for DS9490R can be plugged directly into this board. The only difference is 5V power, which is located on pin 6. \r\n\r\n[DS9490]:http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/3834\r\n\r\n\r\nReal time clock\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n![PoEpi 1-Wire controller](images/PoEpi-rtc.png)\r\n\r\nThe [PCF8583][PCF8583] is also connected to 5V I2C bus. The clock is powered by 5&nbsp;Volt supply when Raspberry Pi is powered on and by Lithium Cell CR2032 otherwise. It uses standard 32768 Hz clock crystal. The frequency can be fine-tuned by the value of the C4 capacitor.\r\n\r\nPower injector\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYou can use almost any „passive PoE“ power injector for various platforms like Mikrotik, Ubiquiti, etc. You can also build your own, as simple as this:\r\n\r\n![PoEpi injector](images/PoEpi-injector.png)\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Ondřej Caletka  \r\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License][lic].  \r\n[![Creative Commons License][licimg]][lic]\r\n\r\n\r\n[lic]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n[licimg]: http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
